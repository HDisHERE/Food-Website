Frittatalicious

The product we chose to design is a recipe website. Users will be able to enter ingredients they already have in the fridge, and our search function will display the recipes, prioritizing those that align closest with the ingredients in the userâ€™s fridge. There will also be an option to apply filters; results can be sorted by cuisine, meal time, prep time and dietary restrictions.
